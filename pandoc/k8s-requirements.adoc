|# Resources

|*Format Notes*

|* All resources should directly map to the Kubernetes Resource Kinds,
Section headings should be human readable * Notes can be used for more
detailed commentary if required

|# Namespaces

|Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be
unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces.

=== # Config and Storage

=== ConfigMaps

ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image
content to keep containerized applications portable.

=== Secrets

A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data
such as a password, a token, or a key.

=== PersistentVolume

A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has
been provisioned by an administrator. It is a resource in the cluster
just like a node is a cluster resource.

=== DaemonSet

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As
nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them.

=== StatefulSet

StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful
applications.

|# Job Types
|===

=== Job

A job creates one or more pods and ensures that a specified number of
them successfully terminate.

* This Section is not required

=== CronJob

A Cron Job creates Jobs on a time-based schedule.

_Notes_ CronJob commands must be detailed in the application
documentation

|===

Note: if running the ``alpine'' container jobs is not viable, we will
need to make the ``queHandler'' cronjob into a separate ``Deployment''
to run the long-running ``queHandler.php'' process. This will not work
as a k8s cronjob, as there is a maximum time that k8s cronjobs (and
jobs) can run for.

|# Custom Resources

* Custom resources are used to define resources that have been added to
the cluster for example KubeDB.

The following
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Custom
Resources] are required.

Custom Resources should follow the format for Kubernetes kinds as above.
